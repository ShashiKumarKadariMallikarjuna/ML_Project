**Machine Learning-Driven Network Security: Behavior Analysis for IoT DDoS Attack Detection**

This project aims to enhance IoT network security through machine learning-driven behavior analysis for Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack detection. The proliferation of IoT devices has introduced new vulnerabilities that cyber attackers exploit to launch DDoS attacks from compromised botnets. Using over 11 million records from the Aposemat IoT-23 dataset containing benign and malicious network traffic labels, extensive data preparation including cleaning, transformation, and sampling is performed. Machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Machine, and K-Nearest Neighbors are developed and evaluated on the task of classifying DDoS and non-DDoS attacks based on network features. Ensemble techniques that combine classifier predictions are also explored. The models demonstrate high accuracy in detecting DDoS attacks from patterns in IoT traffic. Evaluation of individual models and their ensemble techniques reveal Random Forest and KNN outperform SVM. This research thus confirms the potential of machine learning approaches to analyze IoT network behavior and detect security threats like DDoS attacks through network traffic patterns. By providing early detection of such attacks, these techniques can help strengthen security for rapidly growing IoT ecosystems.
